# Titanic-Problem-of-Kaggle
## Algorithms Used - SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest
This is my final year project for college.
I have used several algorithms like SVM, Random Forests, Decision Trees for predicting survived feature of Titanic dataset, along with some basic exploratory modelling and feature engineerig.
A project report file (in PDF) is also attached, which was developed for my college final year project. It has all the details regarding implementation and results.
